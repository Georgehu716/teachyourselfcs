# 1. Introduction to Algorithm Design

insertion sort algorithm implemented in C

```c
insertion_sort(item s[], int n)
{
    int i, j;    /* counters */
    
    for (i=1; i<n; i++) {
        j = i;
        while ((j>0) && (s[j] < s[j-1])) {
            swap(&s[j], &s[j-1]);
            j = j-1;
        }
    }
}
```

There are three desirable properties for a good algorithm. We seek algorithms that are correct and efficient, while being easy to implement.

It is seldom obvious whether a given algorithm correctly solves a given problem. Correct algorithms usually come with a proof of correctness.
